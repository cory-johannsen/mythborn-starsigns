They built bridges where others saw chasms, and sang songs to the stars until the stars sang back. When they vanished, they left behind the gift of adaptability — the courage to be anyone, anywhere.</p><p><strong>Aspect: Versatile Soul.</strong> Once per day, gain a +1 circumstance bonus to any skill check you've never trained before, representing human adaptability.</p>"
