The Myths of the Lost People — The Constellations of Thaloré

“The stars are not cold fire, child — they are memory. Every light above is a name we have forgotten, burning still so that we might one day remember.” — High Astrologer Elunweir, Keeper of the Crown Sky


1. The Wolf Twins — Humanity

Myth: The Twins were said to be the first wanderers of the branches — curious, bold, never still. They built bridges where others saw chasms, and sang songs to the stars until the stars sang back.

Once per day, gain a +1 circumstance bonus to any skill check you’ve never trained before, representing human adaptability.





2. The Stone Father — Dwarves

When his work was done, he sank into the earth beneath the roots, his hammer’s echo forming the heartbeat of Thaloré. Aspect: Enduring Craft. When using the Crafting skill or repairing gear, roll twice and take the better result once per day.





3. The Verdant Crown — Halflings

When sorrow struck the world, they scattered their laughter into the wind and rose as stars so that all might still feel comfort in darkness. Aspect: Joybringer. Once per day, you can inspire courage as if casting Inspire Courage (cantrip level), even if untrained in Performance.





4. The Silent Moon — Gnomes

Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to any Occultism or Nature check involving magical phenomena.





5. The Shadow's Edge — Goblin

Myth:The Goblins burned brighter than any fire they found.

Once per day, you can roll twice to resist the Frightened condition or any fear effect.

Once per day, after reducing an enemy to 0 HP, gain temporary HP equal to your Constitution modifier.





7. The Crystal Bloom — Leshy

Myth:They grew from the tears of Thaloré herself, each petal a memory of those she’d lost. When the Tree healed, they offered themselves back to her as blossoms in the night sky.Aspect: Bloom’s Grace. You can cause minor plant growth in a 10-foot radius once per day, or gain +1 to Medicine checks involving natural remedies.





8. The Seraphic Flame — Nephilim

Myth: Born from light that fell upon dew, the Seraphic Flame sought to illuminate every shadow. When the stars wept, they rose into the sky to tend the wounds of the world. Aspect: Radiant Soul. You shed a faint aura when channeling divine or primal magic; once per day, gain +1 to a saving throw against evil or corruption.
